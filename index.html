        <h3>Here at Geekwise, my goal is to learn how to develop web applications that make it easier for victims in the Fresno Area to locate necessary resources. The criminal justice system can often be complex and confusing-leaving victims to navigate the system on their own. I hope to eventually create a one-stop-shop for victims in the county to look for resources nearby during what may be a difficult and scary time of their life. I hope to also assist small non-profit organizations in developing and building websites! Also, coding is c00l! </h3>
